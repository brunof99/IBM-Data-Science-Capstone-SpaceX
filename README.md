# Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction (IBM Data Science Capstone)

This repository contains the Capstone project from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course. The project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of $62 million. Compared to other providers, which cost upwards of $165 million each, much of the savings is attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Therefore, accurately determining the first stage's landing success can help estimate the cost of a launch. This information is valuable for alternate companies considering bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch contract.
